# Leadership Handbook

Somehow, I took the path of a leader. Being on that journey I come across experiences and insights almost everyday. This book contains my notes, my insights, the things that I have learned on my way to become a leader.

## What should people take away from this book?

* I would like to inspire other leaders or soon-to-be-leaders
* They should learn about the different aspects of being a leader
* They should find sources and opportunities how they can improve themselves
* They should understand, what knowledge fields exists that circle around becoming a leader
* They should take away tools & practices, that they can execute daily, weekly to regularly improve

## What do I want to write about?

* I highlight thought leaders and their work that have inspired me
* I list tools and practices I am using myself
* I give an overview over laws, insights and other sources, that can help understand leadership

## For the impatient

Here is a short list for the impatient on what it's all about. You should read:

* Kamil Sindi's [Manager's Playbook](https://github.com/ksindi/managers-playbook)
